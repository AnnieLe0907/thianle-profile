Dear [Hiring Manager / Internship Coordinator],

I am a Computer Science student at George Mason University, currently seeking an internship opportunity to apply and grow my skills in software and web application development.

Through my coursework, I’ve developed Java-based projects such as a simulation of Conway’s Game of Life, a simple window manager, and a graph-based social network. These experiences helped me strengthen my understanding of object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithm design. I am also familiar with front-end tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and eager to expand into full-stack development.

While my GitHub repositories are currently private due to academic policies, I’d be happy to provide code samples upon request.

I’m passionate about building user-centered, efficient software and am excited to learn and contribute in a real-world development environment. Thank you for considering my application — I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can be a valuable part of your team.

Sincerely,
Thi An Le
